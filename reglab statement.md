I care deeply about using data science for the social good, which was part of the reason for me to move from industry to academia. While I believe that academia is a great outlet to work towards the social good, I would sometimes prefer to also do slightly more applied work, generating tangible positive impact. I applied to the RegLab Summer Institute, because I believe it would be a great opportunity to do just this. I'm especially interested in the Summer Institute, since I greatly enjoyed my previous work in the social good sector when I helped an NGO in the Netherlands to analyse and better understand their data.

## Journal Article
Two journals I have in mind:¬†[https://www.jstatsoft.org/index](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index)¬†and¬†[https://journal.r-project.org/](https://journal.r-project.org/)¬†I wonder what are the requirements to get published there? Publish on CRAN? Other possible journals:¬†[https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software)

- Journal of Statistical Software
	- https://www.jstatsoft.org/about/submissions
	- https://www.jstatsoft.org/authors
	- Requirements
		- Specific PDF style
		- Open Source Code (?), Replication Script for all results mentioned
		- Clear License and GPL or GPL-compatible
	- If possible should be on CRAN
	- Paper as vignette is encouraged, R class system should be used
- Journal of Open Source Software
	- https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html
	- https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html
	- [OSI compatible License](https://opensource.org/licenses)
	- software must have **obvious** research application
	- paper must **not** focus on new results accomplished with said software
	- Paper.md must be in git
	- Git repo must be publicly browsable and ppl need to be able to submit issues
	- Substantial scholarly effort
	- Feature complete, according to standards of packaging
	- Co-publications of a more applied paper should be indicated
		- Automated Test Suite
	- Paper requirements themselves pretty straightforward
		- Short (max 1k words)
		- Mainly giving context, describing the need for the package
		- API itself should be documented within the package, not the paper
- Also: CRAN?
	- `R CMD CHECK` has to pass (easier via devtools::check)
	- Source code for everything has to be provided (i.e. also PDFs etc.), dependencies also have to be availabe
	- 5MB max size (!) (option to split into separate packages)
	- Don't write to filesystem w/o permission (tough one for cache? maybe write to R user dir??)
	- Must have one of these license: https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/share/licenses/license.db
	- Alternative to CRAN: https://r-universe.dev/search/

## Qs Malte
- [ ] Meet Malte next week to Discsuss Auxco data format
- [ ] Put package on github (privately)? (so we can keep the history from now on)
- [ ] Authorship of R package?
- [x] Do we really want to join in the alphabetical coding index?
	- [x] AW: Nein
- [x] Determine a (semi-) final package name?
- [x] Finalize: What do we want to return when no results?
- [x] Finalize: **Suggestions** or predictions?!
- [x] How best to do encryption
	1. Transparent Encryption: Only on Disk in DB
		- little effort
		- no protection if DB access exists
	2. Custom Value Encryption
		- currently implemented
		- harder to maintain
		- no protection if App access exists
	3. Split Private & Public keys
	- Muss es auf computer speichern k√∂nnen
		- CSV oder SQLite
	- Wollen es irgendwo anders speichern
- [x] Maybe: occupationCoding vs the package, which does what are the interoperable?
	- [x] Function to generate training data / probabilities, copy over from occupationCoding
- [x] DTM only used for word names?!
- [x] Merge w/ default app settings

	- [x] Separate training data files / pre-trained models
	- [ ] add kldb3 support (just grouping stuff and joining in things!)
- [ ] Move "machen sie etwas anderes" text field to separate page
- [ ] Auto-Render buttons (use session history to hide prev., not sure what about next??)
- [ ] Add even more tests
- [ ] Use updated Auxco data format
	- [ ] And skip followup questions if possible
	- [ ] Re: API maybe provide followup answers as key value lists
- [ ] Final Polishing üíÖ
	- [ ] Document Datasets

	- [ ] only via a search / text distance over the available options
		- [ ] support all 3 coding systems and disambiguate between output and matching
		- [ ] use the detailed descriptions / tasks in ESCO, possibly support 

### Ideas
- Packages as application
	- similar to JASP / Jamovi??
	- https://www.travishinkelman.com/deploy-shiny-electron/
		- https://github.com/wleepang/DesktopDeployR (most likely option)
		- https://chasemc.github.io/electricShine/
- Python or R??
- Encodings
	- ISCO - International Coding
	- Kldb - German coding
		- basis of current training data
	- AuxCo - made by malte, has mappigns to ISCO & Kldb, has follow up questions (currently used as outcome)
	- ESCO (european coding, more specific version adding extra numbers to ISCO)
		- translated into all sorts of languages
		- might want to switch to this, to allow international coding out-of-the-box
- https://towardsdatascience.com/string-matching-with-bert-tf-idf-and-more-274bb3a95136
- Privacy of free text training data?!

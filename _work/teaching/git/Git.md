		- Have footsnotes on most pages with helpful information
	- Syllabus / High-Level Course Overview
	- Installation Instructions PDF / Website
	- Cheatsheet (Existing)
	- Each practical as one document (?)

- Maybe have some logic / math puzzles as coursework?

- Set-Up
	- Mix between theory and practicals
		- Three practicals?

	- Have them perform practicals both via CLI and GUI
	- Have most of them be done in pairs? (maybe for everyone, one person das CLI the other das GUI??)

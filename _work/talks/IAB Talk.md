## Outline

- occupation coding: the problem
	- many many jobs -> so we have classification systems (ISCO, KldB)
	- many categories in these systems -> experts do the coding, post-hoc
- the solution (1) / the problem (2)
	- computer assisted tools
	- simplest version: match via text
	- data scientist -> barrakuda tauchlehrer
	- difficulties
		- highly sensitive data
		- hard to anonymize (bcs free text)
		- many categories to classify into
		- often unclear categories
		- hard to use between countries (language, often slightly different jobs)
- our solution: ML based
	- briefly summarise Malte's paper on algo comparison
- our solution: during the interview
	- mention hard to distinguish categories
	- AuxCo as solution (unique)
		- developed by Malte
- the package
	- developed a new R package "occupationMeasurement"
	- implements this ML method
	- comes with training data (anonymized), but only works with this type of model (or closely related ones)
	- its own interactive web app
		- you can use your own questionnaires if you so wish to
		- we have three pre-made ones
	- API (if e.g. you want to use qualtrics or some other existing tool)
		- Currently testing this together with forsa
	- exposes R functions

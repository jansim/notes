**Title:**
WorldWideLab Brainstorm: Citizen Science For All
**Summary:** 
I'll briefly talk about the idea behind WorldWideLab, the current plans for the project and how it compares to pushkin, the technology that powers themusiclab.org right now. We're interested to hear your feedback about these ideas and any pain-points in regards to creating games for themusiclab.org or using data from the site right now.

#occ 

- save time on the introduction
	- people know about occupation coding already
- present main results from the tool in more detail
- Talk duration
	- 12-15 minute talk
	- 5-3 minute discussion / questions

- What kind of results?
> Also, after reading what our friend Bernhard wrote about identification of leadership positions when using our tool (that the tool might be not performing the best when it aims to identify abteilungleiter and jobs like that), I looked at the survey data.  
> What we have there is the following:  
if we have 3 first digits correct, and the 4th digit is wrong (tool doesn‚Äôt match with manual coding), the digit 9 (management) and digit 1 (i don‚Äôt remember)¬† are the most frequent reasons for mismatch.  
If we assume the manual coding is correct, then occupations with the fourth digit 9 (as given by manual coding) are most likely to be not identified by the tool at all (25% of cases). For other fourth digits auxco isn‚Äôt providing suggestions in 10-15% of cases.  
But if the first four digits are correct (aka manual matches the tool), with the fourth digit being 9, then the fifth digit will also be correct in 38 out of 50 cases we have in the sample. So Malte you were right, that the fifth digit is not that much of a problem for the tool and respondents, but the fourth digit might be.

## Future Ideas

- Occupation Coding Group 14.07.23
	- FastTest for embedding with NN behind the scenes for classifications
	- Include Bigrams for better perf
- 

## ESRA Presentation
- Meeting on Monday to go over slides in detail
- Drop the difficulties of occupation coding or just skip in talk
- Merge 3 & 4??
	- Occupation coding is hard / issues
- 10 slides maximum
- Crowd: More occupation coding, less ML
- Skip #8 (the algorithm)
- Could skip #9 (our method) -- if too many slides
- Make demonstration a priority
- Merge following sldies into #15 (what's in the toolbox)
	- make it a fast one
	- mention that it's on CRAN?
- Use Schierholz 2021 numbers in earlier performacne slide (red ones)

### Ideas
- Packages as application
	- similar to JASP / Jamovi??
	- https://www.travishinkelman.com/deploy-shiny-electron/
		- https://github.com/wleepang/DesktopDeployR (most likely option)
		- https://chasemc.github.io/electricShine/
- Python or R??
- Encodings
	- ISCO - International Coding
	- Kldb - German coding
		- basis of current training data
	- AuxCo - made by malte, has mappigns to ISCO & Kldb, has follow up questions (currently used as outcome)
	- ESCO (european coding, more specific version adding extra numbers to ISCO)
		- translated into all sorts of languages
		- might want to switch to this, to allow international coding out-of-the-box

- Privacy of free text training data?!

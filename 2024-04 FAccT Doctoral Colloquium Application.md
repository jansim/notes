Summary of doctoral thesis, describing work to date and future plans (max 2,000 characters)


In my doctoral thesis, I re-evaluate the complete machine learning pipeline from the sourcing of data, over the design of ML systems all the way to their implementation with an eye on the fairness and robustness of systems. Together with my collaborators and advisors, I develop new methodologies and collect data to better understand the reliability of findings in the field. We further critically examine the usage and composition of datasets, highlighting gaps and providing recommendations for more sustainable practices. Among other things, we focus on the influence of design decisions, highlighting potential issues of fairness hacking and introducing a new methodology to systematically study and address issues of reliability.

I have so far managed to complete two projects for my thesis, both of which I will present at this year's FAccT. The first project is a critical analysis of datasets, how they are used within the field of algorithmic fairness and how well they represent vulnerable populations. The second project introduces multiverse analyses for algorithmic fairness, a systematic analysis of how preprocessing and other decisions during model design affect a systems fairness and performance. At the moment I am working on two other projects, with the intent of addressing some of the issues we discovered when examining the usage of fairness datasets. The first new project will be a systematic collection of datasets used in fairness research, alongside a software solution to allow for easy use of multiple datasets in studies with recommendations on how to construct a diverse set of datasets. The second new project is intended to help with the sourcing of new data, by creating a new software solution for large-scale online data collection and donation. I am also planning to work on a practical case study / applied project as well as methods of participatory design and would be particularly grateful for any input in that direction as part of the doctoral colloquium.

## Summary of background and relevant experience
Summary of background and relevant experience  (research, education, employment, links to any relevant reports or publications) (max 2,000 characters) *

I draw on a diverse background and experience in my work across both industry and academia. Before starting my PhD in Statistics and joining the graduate school in reliable AI where I am right now, I worked in industry as a Data Analyst for a Dutch grocery startup. Earlier, I spent a year as a research fellow at Harvard University, helping to launch a citizen science platform which to date collected millions of participants and analysing participants' data to better understand how we perceive music. I also have a degree in Psychology with a specialisation in Behavioural Data Science and completed a vocational education in computer science. Through my vocational education, I have extensive experience in programming and web development, which I had used to finance my academic studies.

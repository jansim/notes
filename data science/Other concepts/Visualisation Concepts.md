#### Boxplots
Common plotting form for distributions. The box itself corresponds to the IQR, from Q1 (25%) over the middle line at the Median (Q2; 50%) to Q3 (75%).

The typical convention for whiskers is to have them go from min to max, IF these two fall within 1.5 IQR from Q1 and Q3 respectively. If any points fall outside of this range, the whisker will only go until 1.5 IQR and points outside will be marked as outliers!

Alternatively, whiskers might always just go from min to max.

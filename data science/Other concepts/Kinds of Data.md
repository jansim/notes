Data can be organized into one of three categories, depending on how structured it is.

## Structured
- organized in rows and columns
- rigid format
- e.g. relational databases, CSV, data frames

## Semi-Structured
- Part of the data is consistently structured, part of the data is not
- e.g. emails (there is always from, to and title, but text bodies are very diverse and unstructred), often also XML / JSON

## Unstructured
- not organized in rows and columns
- often complex and qualitative
- e.g. photos, videos, text

Trends are currently leaning towards more unstructured data.

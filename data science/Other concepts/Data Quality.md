- Absolutely crucial for data science and analysis
- Impossible to get good results with bad data, no matter the model
	- Garbage in - Garbage out

## Aspects
- Accuracy
	- no duplicates, NAs etc.
	- uniform formatting
- Completeness
	- is the necessary data there to answer the question / solve the problem?
- Reliability
	- Can we trust the data?
	- Is the data what it's supposed to be?
- Relevance
	- Is the data actually releant / necessary for analyses? (esp. re privacy!)

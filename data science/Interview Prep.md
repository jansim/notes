## Typical Questions

### How to deal with missing data
It depends:
- If high N we might be able to just drop the observations
- If the setting permits it, we might be able to impute missing observations. (Could also just be set to 0 if it makes sense)

### How would you go about building a system to recommend new music for someone?
There are two approaches to this problem, we could either recommend music similar to the one the person has listened to (content-based recommendations) or we could identify similar people in our dataset and recommend the music they listened to in the past (collaborative filtering).

## Recommender Systems
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Based on other users w/ similar interests i.e. recommend music similar people also listened to
- **Content-based Filtering**: Based on properties of the thing itself i.e. recommend music w/ similar properties

## Typical Questions

### How to deal with missing data
It depends:
- If high N we might be able to just drop the observations
- If the setting permits it, we might be able to impute missing observations. (Could also just be set to 0 if it makes sense)

## Concepts
- Unsupvervised vs Supervised Machine Learning

- **Law of Large Numbers**: Back-bone of freq. statistics; 
- **Selection Bias**: Error due to non-random sample from population
- **Survivorship Bias**: Non-random dropout leading to weird sample.

- **One-hot encoding / Dummy coding**: Turn categorical variables into numerical ones.

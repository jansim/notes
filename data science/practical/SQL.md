# SQL: Structured Query Language
Base language to interact with databases, was standardized by ANSI back in the day.

Multiple database specific flavors exist.

SQL statements fall into one of two categories
- DDL: Data Definition Language
	- On table level e.g. CREATE, ALTER, DELETE
- DML: Data Manipulation Language
	- Work with actual data e.g. INSERT, UPDATE
	- Corresponds to CRUD (create, update, delete)

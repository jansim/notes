- https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js
	- slow development (at best), examples don't work reliably on iOS
	- new: image markers
	- kein zugang zu ARkit...
- 8thwall

	- https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/
	- https://cwervo.com/writing/quicklook-web/#ios-13
	- Android: USDZ support limited, could create AR.js fallback
- Alternative (not really AR but ML) => Tensorflow.js [DEMOS](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/blob/master/GALLERY.md)
	- [PoseAnimator](https://github.com/yemount/pose-animator/) - Animate any SVG character using your own body live via your webcam. Uses posenet and facemesh to create some really unique animations.
-   [3D Face Doodles](https://github.com/cyrildiagne/ar-facedoodle) - What if your face was a canvas and you could paint on it in real time? Check out this experiment that does just that in real time in the browser.
-   [Shaderbooth](https://shaderbooth.com/?85daa) - Experiment with WebGL Shaders + TensorFlow.js to create stunning visual effects such as shooting lasers from your eyes and more!

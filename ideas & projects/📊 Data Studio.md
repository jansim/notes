## ToDo / Next Steps
- [ ] update iframe module system
	- [ ] rename to plugins (to avoid name conflicts with internal JS modules?)
	- [ ] allow developing a plugin w/o running in the full tool i.e. mirror api in dev mode or sth
	- [ ] properly implement security to not leak data
	- [ ] allow loading of external modules
		- [ ] prob. need to clear up the distinction between plugin-description/manifest and plugin code/instance
	- [ ] Allow arrow as data system
- [x] document code
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add new Plugins
	- [ ] Kanaries/graphic-walker
	- [ ] duckdb/wasm
- [ ] Only unload modules when the underlying data actually changes
- [x] Support multiple datasets
- [x] Update module viewer
	- [x] Use Tabulator for table rendering
- [ ] Summary charts in header via formatters (?)
- [x] Add perspective library
- [x] Add https://github.com/plotly/react-pivottable
- [x] Add https://github.com/plotly/react-chart-editor
- [ ] Advertise
- [ ] VSCode Extension
	- [ ] Theming support so as to not stand out (based on a few lead colors)
- [ ] Rename
	- VAstudio
	- VA-studio
	- VA Studio
	- Analysys
	- Analy-Sys
	- Analyst Studio
	- DA Studio
	- EDA Studio
	- Data Explorer
- [x] Support to paste data (excel & csv)
	- [x] Check excel
- [ ] Compare dataframes!!
- [ ] Implement packages in R, Python, Jupiter, vscode, Julia 
- [ ] SQL Support
	- [ ] duckdb-wasm
		- [ ] Use duckdb as data backend in the long run?? (downside: 1.8M WASM loading, **after** compressing!!)
		- [ ] Maybe support two backends - small & large
			- [ ] Duckdb performance much higher on large, complex data (which is unusable atm anyways)
			- [ ] On small <1k rows data arquero outperforms
	- [ ] SQL.js
- [ ] JS Support
	- [ ] Simple REPL, prob. via monaco editor alt. codemirror (same REPL for SQL)
	- [ ] Support for dataviz libraries e.g. observable plot, d3, ... basically a clone of observable?
	- [ ] Add a snippet with arquero
- [ ] Move to Typescript?
- [ ] Loading indicator

## Spec
For posting it online
- Useful enough so that I want to use it for EDA

## Summary
- Top Bar:
	- Very Left list of datasets (across modules)
	- Top: selection of modules (like word / JASP)
- Modules
	- Load Data
		- From file (via drag and drop)
		- 
	- Wrangle
	- Viz e.g. Voyager etc etc


## Ideas
- Tools to use:
	- Observable Data Wrangler (https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/data-wrangler)
	- Voyager 2
	- SandDance
	- Kepler.gl
	- Perspective
	- rawgraphs.io
	- other dataviz tools
	- Small graphs at top of columns

- SQL Query Support via SQL.js 
- Observable-Like Interface

- mito.io or tablum.io
- Other interesting, but prob less relevant
	- https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation
- Tad, app to view & explore datasets https://github.com/antonycourtney/tad
	- might have some interesting sub packages
	- uses duckdb behind the scenes

There are a multitude of different ways to earn a living which is why peopleâ€™s occupations are almost as diverse as people themselves. Therefore, one of the classic issues one encounters when working with occupational data is the vast heterogeneity of occupations people have. To address this problem, a variety of different classifications have been developed, such as the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) or the German Klassifikation der Berufe (KldB), narrowing down the number of occupation categories into more manageable numbers.

This leads to a different problem, however: The coding of occupations into standardized categories is a time-intensive process plagued by reliability issues. To date the standard approach to code occupations is by collecting free text responses and having specifically trained personnel sit down with the classification manual, possibly assisted by computer software, to assign each category by hand post-hoc. Since coding typically occurs after data collection and with limited information, the assignment of categories is often ambiguous and unreliable.

Here we present a new instrument which implements a faster, more convenient and interactive occupation coding workflow where interviewees are included in the coding process. Using the best performing algorithm from a previous comparison of machine learning models, a list of suggested occupation categories is generated to be selected by the interviewee. Issues of ambiguity within occupational categories are addressed with clarifying follow-up questions. The instrument is implemented as part of a flexible toolbox, covering the whole process from data collection and questionnaire design to the final coding of occupations into KldB and ISCO. Anonymized training data from German surveys and pre-trained machine-learning models for Germany are provided as part of the toolbox.

The toolbox is implemented as an open-source package and will be available at [https://github.com/occupationMeasurement/occupationMeasurement](https://github.com/occupationMeasurement/occupationMeasurement).

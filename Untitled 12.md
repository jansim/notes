When choosing which data to use for training an AI model, it's crucial to decide which characteristics to include. In our case, we have specific considerations about including certain potentially sensitive characteristics like sex or race.

These are sometimes excluded due to legal reasons in AI systems. However, studies have shown that excluding these sensitive attributes doesn't always make the models fairer, as these attributes can be related to other information.  
  
_Please choose which of the following options you consider acceptable:_

- **Do not exclude any sensitive attributes.** This means using all available features as predictors, including sensitive attributes like race and sex.
- **Exclude race from the model**. This means not using race as a predictor for our model.
- **Exclude sex from the model**. This means not using sex as a predictor for our model.

●      **Exclude both race and sex from the model**: This means removing both race and sex as predictors.

## Summary / Action Points
- We learned: Preprocessing for arabic is very different from other languages (i.e. stemming makes no sense) and @Regina is going to add / improve preprocessing

- Next: Looking at different forms of modelling
- Further Steps
	- Improve our evaluation tools e.g. add confusion matrix
	- Add weighting based on the uneven class distributions
	- Investigate mislabeled data?
	- Add tools of explainable machine learning e.g. LIME /SHAP => https://towardsdatascience.com/lime-vs-shap-which-is-better-for-explaining-machine-learning-models-d68d8290bb16
	- Use a TF-IDF as additional features?
	- Use some insights from this paper? => https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337796233_Arabic_Text_Classification_of_News_Articles_Using_Classical_Supervised_Classifiers

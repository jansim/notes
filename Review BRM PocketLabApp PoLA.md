## Suggestions
- Software Tests
- CI / CD
- Look at requirements for JOSS (an interesting alternative outlet)
- Documentation website
- Google Play Store
- F-Droid et al

## ToCheck
- AI Features do seem a bit odd, welcome that they're out of the MS, could be more distinguished from the rest of the software in documentation as well
- Was not able to test software
- Does it also trigger by itself?
- Any line w/o command is ignored?
	- Not a good idea in terms of software design


- Page 7 L 46 in "the" Kotlin
- Page 7 L 49 no citation for 56%
- pinning app to screen is not mentioned in documentation
- not suitable for EMA?

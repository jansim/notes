## Short description
Jan received his Bachelors in Psychology from the University of Konstanz in Germany, after previously completing a vocational education as a Specialised Computer Scientist in Application Development. In 2021, he received his Master's Degree in Psychology: Behavioural Data Science at the University of Amsterdam.

In between his Bachelor's and Master's, Jan spend a year working at The Music Lab at Harvard University, helping to develop a citizen science website and trying to better understand how we perceive music. He has been working as a web developer alongside his studies and during his time in Amsterdam he has helped with the development of new analyses for JASP as free and open-source statistics application. Before joining the LMU and returning to academia, Jan was working as a Data Analyst at Picnic, a grocery-delivery startup founded in the Netherlands, where he conducted analyses of the company's pricing and developed multiple internal tools, dashboards and automations.

Jan's work typically lies at the intersection of Psychology and Data Science, trying to bring aspects from one into the world of the other. He is part of a project to build an open-source tool to improve the coding of occupations into standard categories and he's excited about making machine learning and the processes surrounding it easier to understand and more fair in the future.

Seit Juli 2022 ist **Jan Simson** als Doktorand am Institut für Statistik, Lehrstuhl SODA unter Leitung von Prof. Frauke Kreuter tätig.

**Jan** schloss 2021 sein Studium in Psychologie mit einer Spezialisierung in Behavioural Data Science an der Universität Amsterdam ab. Er hat zuvor ein Jahr in den USA zu Musikwahrnehmung geforscht und dabei mitgeholfen eine Citizen Science Website aufzubauen. In seiner Abschlussarbeit beschäftigte er sich unter anderem mit der Vorhersage von Präferenzdaten zu Musik. Am Lehrstuhl wird er vorraussichtlich an einem Tool zur besseren Kodierung von Berufen arbeiten und sich mit der Fairness von ML basierten Entscheidungen auseinandersetzen. Jan geht gerne Bouldern/Klettern, Wandern und Tennis spielen und ist immer für einen Brettspielabend zu haben!

**Jan** studied Psychology with a specialisation in Behavioural Data Science at the University of Amsterdam, graduating in 2021. Previously, he spent a year working at a research lab in the States, research music perception and helping to launch a citizen science website. In his thesis he worked on predicing muscial preference. At the LMU he will most likely be working on a tool to improve the coding of occupations and will look into fairness of ML based decision making. In his free time, Jan likes to go bouldering/climbing, hiking, play tennis or spend an evening playing board games!

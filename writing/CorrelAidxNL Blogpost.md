# Interventions in Kenya

> Analyzing data on thousands of Interventions conducted by the Dutch NGO Macheo during a 3-month internship at CorrelAidxNL

In the summer of 2020, I spent a total of 3 months working at CorrelAidxNL as a data science intern. During that time I worked on multiple projects, spending the majority of my time on a project in collaboration with Macheo.

Macheo is a Dutch charity operating in Thika, Kenya, where it aims to help children in the urban slums and rural areas surrounding the city. The organization does this by providing interventions to children or their parents which can range from providing school lunches to kids all the way to monetary help for parents to start a business. As part of this project I helped Macheo conduct analyses on the intervention efficiency data they collect. I will talk about the course of the project, how I found a number of surprising issues in the data and the way the project changed its scope to stay on track towards the key goal of providing value to the charity.

## Before

-  server changeover will affect our db mirror & weekly processing scripts, will need to update those once the new setup is sorted out
- we're reaching a point where we *really* need updated docs for WWL for all sorts of details, including the basic "how does a student take their jspsych and stick it on wwl" but also a variety of other things like the data exporting process (just to write down what's happening and when); covariate selection and how to handle turning that stuff on/off in new games; url parameters; autoscaling management; etc  
- MIQ autoscaling should probably be addressed somehow, even if this fix is separate from other TML autoscaling management, since that game is likely to go viral again  
- plans for NSF grant, if any (?)  
- plans for WWL paper


- [ ] Change of server?
- [ ] Updates to docs
- [ ] MIQ autoscaling -> will look into it
- [ ] New in-development study on AI design

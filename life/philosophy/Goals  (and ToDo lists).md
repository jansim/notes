## Process Goals vs Outcome Goals
Outcome goals refer to what we want to achieve whereas process goals refer to what we want to do / what time we want to commit to an action.

Because whether or not we succeed in achieving outcome goals is often outside of our control it can be better to focus on setting process goals instead.

> Idea: Might be best to set outcome goals with nested process goals underneath?

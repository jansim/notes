Luck Razor:  
  
If given 2 options, pick the one that has more luck potential.  
  
E.g. Cocktail party vs watching Netflix.  
  
Which one has the highest potential for future luck?  
  
Run equal A/B decisions through this razor.

Get Good At Marketing:  
  
The ultimate meta-skill.  
  
It crosses over to every area of life.  
  
If you can create a persuasive ad or landing page, you can create a persuasive CV or job interview.  
  
Lifehack: Most people are awful at marketing.

Reverse Prison Advice:  
  
The cliche advice to a new prisoner is to punch the biggest person in the prison.  
  
Flip this on its head.  
  
Find the best people you know and help. (Share their projects, give feedback, make intro’s etc)

Smart Friends Razor:  
  
If unsure about a small bet but your smart friends are sure - take the bet  
  
If you wait for the rest of society to confirm it, you'll be too late  
  
[@tomosman](https://twitter.com/tomosman) + [@jackbutcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher) told me about Bored Ape Yacht Club very early on and I ignored it

Pursue High Leverage Relaxation:  
  
Rank all relaxation activities on this:  
  
1. How much it relaxes you  
2. How quick it takes to do  
  
Find the highest leverage one across both scores. Do it regularly.  
  
It's hard to notice lucky opportunities when cortisol is through the roof.

Avoid Boring People:  
  
1. Avoid people that bore you.  
  
2. Avoid being the boring person in the room.  
  
Be interesting. And seek interesting friends.  
  
People will remember you when they have an interesting opportunity.

DM's Are The Hack Of The Century:  
  
• Most DM's: 0 value. Asking for help. Looks like a scam or time sink.  
  
• Lucky DM's: Provide value. Give help. Look legit.

Avoid Toxic People:  
  
It's hard to notice lucky opportunities when you're arguing — or replaying arguments in your head.  
  
Toxic people are to luck what water is to fire.

Poker Mindset > Roulette Mindset:  
  
Ridiculous but true statement...  
  
Playing a game of roulette thinking it's poker is better than playing a game of poker thinking it’s roulette.  
  
Assume everything is a game of skill and there's always something you can control.

Obsess Over Environment  
  
Move to the city with the highest chance of luck for you.  
  
If you can't physically move, do it digitally.  
  
Find like-minded people on Discord and Twitter. Provide value.

Introduce People  
  
If friend A and friend B can get value from each other - intro them.  
  
It's a 30-second email for you and may change their lives forever.  
  
"Networks are the only things that don't divide when you share them. They multiply." - [@ChrisWillx](https://twitter.com/ChrisWillx)

Delete The Scoreboard  
  
Don’t wait for others to do nice things for you before you do nice things for them  
  
Just relentlessly give to good people with no scoreboard in your head keeping track  
  
You’ll end up lucky, fulfilled and your funeral will be packed

Get More Curious With Age  
  
Curiosity is like your joints - it weakens with age  
  
You’ll dismiss great opportunities as a fad  
  
Assume your first thoughts about new trends are wrong  
  
Age like Gary Vee or Mark Cuban  
  
Put 20 hours into new trend before you have an opinion

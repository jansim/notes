# My Personal VR setup

I wake up at 5:30, and do some deep work; at 7:15 an alarm goes off, which reminds me to fire up my [Oculus Quest](https://www.oculus.com/quest/) and start my VR workout.  
  
I clear out my workout space and make sure my cats aren't in the main play area.

-   Mia is absolutely fearless, so she needs to be moved
-   Umrao slinks off as soon he sees me clearing the play area  
    

**Of note:** Generally, more space = a more vigorous workout.  
  

## **My favorite games**

I tend to like games where working out is a side effect of the fast-paced gameplay. I've tried some workout-focused games and they haven't really done it for me.  It felt like punishment instead of pleasure.  

At the same time, I've tested many fun games that turned out to not be vigorous enough to get a great workout with. Thankfully Oculus has a decent return policy.  

Below are my 4 favorite games for working out.  

### [**Thrill of The Fight**](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3008315795852749/)

**Description:** Boxing without the concussions.  
**Intensity:** Very high. Most physically intense game I've found.  
**Notes:** As I find myself improving at boxing in this game, I wonder how much will apply to real-life boxing. My guess is that punching and blocking habits will have improved, but I will have probably picked up some bad habits with footwork and balance.  
  

### [**Pistol Whip**](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2104963472963790/)

**Description:** First-person shooter to a soundtrack.  Incredible experience.  
**Intensity:** High.  It’ll sneak up on you.  
**Notes:** I've found this is exceptional for practicing my alter ego for calm under pressure.  
  

### [**Ninja Legends**](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2398880980156491/?locale=en_US)

**Description:** Fight multiple opponents at once, as a ninja.  
**Intensity:** High, especially with _Endless Mode_ for extended cardio.  
  

### [**Audio Trip**](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2484044451715693/)

**Description:** If I may take liberties: Guitar Hero for VR.  
**Intensity:** Medium-High; slightly less intense than the other games. I like to use it for enjoyable cool-downs.  
**Notes:** Psychedelic, soulful, immersive environments and music while you compete. More intense than the well-known Beat Saber, which I find fun but not vigorous enough for a workout. The makers of Audio Trip are a married couple with a great story.

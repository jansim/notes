## Principles
- *doing* what's right more important than *being* right 
- Put things into perspective
  - in regards to own life
  - In regards to overall world & history
-  what values to live by? How to measure value?
  - should be in own control
  - 
- embrace uncertainty: be comfortable with not knowing what's gonna happen, because you can't control it anyways
- do Something Principle: See doing something (the action itself) as a success in and of itself, don't use result as measure of success; Motivstion and results wil follow
- Enjoy what live has to offer, but be prepared to lose it. Don't take things for granted. -> Stoicism
- what is worth doing even if I fail?

## Heuristics
- Highlight, we are not at the Center of the Universe (Even though our experience is like it)! [src](https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/)
- take responsibility for everything that happens in one's life 
- ask yourself: what if I'm wrong? AITA?!
- Praise specifically (a person and their behavior); critique generally only the behavior / approach in general
- To increase reliability of tasks / processes => use checklists [> the checklist manifesto](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtmmP4YdJEfK9y4Rc/book-review-the-checklist-manifesto)
- importance of reading
- you pay compound interest on tough decisions when you just put them off for a later day
- Don't make excuses when failing => always look at what could've been done better
- One of the main things holding us back is the unwillingness to look stupid in the short term
- When someone asks, any questions and you say that you don't have one... it's not about not having a question, it's saying I don't care enough to voice a question and risk looking stupid
- people don't want what you want -> figure out where they come from, what they want ie empathy!

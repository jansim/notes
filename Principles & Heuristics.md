## Principles
- *doing* what's right more important than *being* right 
- Put things into perspective
  - in regards to own life
  - In regards to overall world & history
-  what values to live by? How to measure value?
  - should be in own control
  - 
- embrace uncertainty: be comfortable with not knowing what's gonna happen, because you can't control it anyways
- do Something Principle: See doing something (the action itself) as a success in and of itself, don't use result as measure of success; Motivstion and results wil follow

- take responsibility for everything that happens in one's life 
- ask yourself: what if I'm wrong? AITA?!
- Praise specifically (a person and their behavior); critique generally only the behavior / approach in general

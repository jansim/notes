## Feedback Frauke

- "will help overcome the problem of sparse data"???
- data science vs data analysis
	- tasks sound more like data analyst?
	- very little focus on ML tasks
- Not a lot of information on the "how?" i.e. many data problems, but how to solve them?
- Task 2: Chart unuderstanding
	- Confused 
- high level vs code

- toolformer?

1. Does the summary refer (ideally in the first sentences)  
to the main challenges we address in the TRR?  
(i) representations and formalisms for expert domains  
(ii) sparse data  
	- What is sparse data in this context?
	- How does this refer to sparse data?
(iii) human-centric aspects  
(iv) complexity/multimodality of expert domains.
2. Does the summary explain (ideally in the last paragraph)  
why the subproject needs the TRR and why its contributions to  
the TRR are crucial?
	- What's the last paragraph??
3. Did the research questions and planned research  
contributions of the subproject become clear to you?
4. Does the subproject proposal make clear and convincing  
reference to one or more use cases?
5. Do the work packages describe the collaborations with  
other subprojects within the TRR and why these  
collaborations are needed (for the subproject as well as for  
the TRR)?
6. A key section for the TRR Begehung is:  
X00.5 Role within the Collaborative Research Centre  
Are you happy with this section, in particular, is it a  
two-way street, i.e., the subproject benefits from the TRR, and  
the TRR benefits from the subproject?

## Notes during

- My Q: Currently our tool is very much focused on German

## Summary / Action Points
- Tool > Algorithm
- Double Down on Plug 'n Play rather than Algo / retraining
- JOSS checklist
- Explicitly state that it's an R package
- Be explicit abt German
- Interviewee vs Respondent
- self administered vs interview administered -> be explicit abt supporting both
- how does it allow these new things ?
	- be a bit more clear in paper itself
- submit to CRAN
-

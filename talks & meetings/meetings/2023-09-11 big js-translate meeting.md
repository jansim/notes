Jan is working on adding support for translations to jsPsych. When I started doing this, I became more and more aware of how complicated this can actually get when trying to do it right and taking into account how different languages behave differently beyond just having different words for things e.g. grammar when inserting a number into a piece of text, different forms of pluralisation of words and also things like different key positions on keyboards, which can obviously affect responses and response times. And this doesnâ€™t even take into account yet the more subtle different in cultures that go beyond just language. Therefore we got the idea of using this project as an opportunity to first collect the important pitfalls and best practices when creating international online experiments and then designing the technical implementation around these to make it as easy as possible to build a good experiment. The final result could then be a paper that explains all best practices and important issues to take into consideration and (where applicable) how to implement these using our solution. There will probably also be many points that go beyond just the technical side of things, which we would also discuss / highlight in the paper.

## Notes during

 What makes up a dissertation
 - lots of room, unclear what's enough, what isn't
 - Felix: Frauke looked at it, pitches it to Thomas Augustin
 - no clear 3 papers published, peer-reviewed single author ruling
 - the equivalent of 3 journal papers
 - shorter papers, cool technology / code developed -> also fine
 - maybe: write a dissertation prospectus
 - whatever you have in your mind: it's probably too much
 - papers can be on different topics
 - when is it excellent?
	 - a good dissertation looks at a topic from different angles
		 - can also be within a paper
 - outside of Germany: there are no grades
 - topic
	 - in the end interesting scientific contributions matter
	 - not to get too hung up on statistics / relAI focus
 - overview paper
	 - basically you're writing a prospectus
	 - what are the gaps

- double check whether you have the copyright to include your paper in thesis

- write a prospectus
- assemble a set of people (i.e. potential committee) and run the idea by them

- author contributions should be written down and signed by everyone
	- we will / should see samples soon-ish in dissertations

- commitee
	- one other person from dpt
	- advisor
	- usually 3 - 4; no upper limit
	- Prüfungsausschuss already exits; separate from Comittee
	- Prüfungsausschuss looks at committee ~ 6 months before submission

- timeframe
	- having a feeling of roughly what you want to do; you should have at the end of first year

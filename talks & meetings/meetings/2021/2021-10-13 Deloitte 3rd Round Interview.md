	- I can be a bit shy sometimes e.g. in public speaking (seek out opportunities to still do it and overcome my nervousness); 
	- I can struggle with keeping up boundaries with work so that it doesn't bleed into personal life (esp the case in academia; so I try to be explicit about work / non-work time)
	- I don't have the greatest memory (stuff like learn this list of facts and dates I struggle with); combat this by condensing information down
- Tell me about your biggest failure at work
	- Struggled to find a full on failure, but e.g. during internship I noticed occasions where in hindsight I could've approached a problem better e.g. at some point unreliable data export, but could've still worked with that already

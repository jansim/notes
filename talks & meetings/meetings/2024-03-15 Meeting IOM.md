## Notes during
- 2)
	- ML would be out of scope for them and great addition by DSSG
	- They probably have everything in place by august? (how can we be sure of that / what could go wrong?!)
	- cross border migration // internal displacement
		- impact of event on migration (both of these) get estimated; then.. what does that impact mean in # of people?
	- signal EXCEL document
		- right now they look at number of news outlets where they manually categorize things
		- if they keep up current pace, they'd be at N = ~ 500 by July / August
- 3) Big / Open Data Sources for Migration Signals
	- Google Trends + social media data from #1 (sentiment analysis)
	- Would use same data as #2??
	- hope to have similar outputs as #2? very similar / same???
	- Social Media data probably having to be paid
		- can only get current-ish data really
		- Twitter data the only one where you can get long history of data
	- IOM: Not sure abt this one
		- What is it that we can do with this?
		- more a means to an end rather than a project itself?
		- They'll define a bit in the next few months how tools will be used (in their offices)
- 4) 
	- Right now they harvest a lot by hand and accumulate it in excel
	- Maybe we can automate this?
	- List of data sources is being built right now
	- Looking at country level indicators -> produced by partners
		- forecast of el nino
- Trying out some microsoft platform to have all data (?) in one place
	- microsoft fabric

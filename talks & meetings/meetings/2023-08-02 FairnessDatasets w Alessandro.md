#fairness-datasets 
## Notes during

- Final verdict: **One row per PredictionTask**
- potential: Issue
	- Datasets used for Multi-Task classification
- Batches of datasets
	- First Focus: tabular data, binary classification
- Case Study
	- What do we want to show?
	- What Method are we comparing?
		- Bias Mitigation Techniques
		- Fairness Metrics
	- Multiple Evaluations for a given Algo; for each dataset -> what is the ratio of privileged to non-privligeded? What is ratio in positive / negative class?
		- Metrics: Comparing just the raw ratios, without any predicitions
		- overall positive rate can affect fairness metrics
	- There's a gap here, bcs people have been focusing on datasets with these features but not *these* features?


- What did we do
- Introducing Meta-Dataset
	- Descriptively showing Meta-Dataset
- Illustrate usefulness of Met-Dataset via Case Study

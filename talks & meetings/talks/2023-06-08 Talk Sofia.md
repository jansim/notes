## Questions
1. Comment: Speaking abt fairness, we almost always decouple classification from decision making that the classification leads to. We cannot decouple the two. Imagine these classifications are actually used to allocate resources.
	- There's no problem with using race / ethnicity if it leads to higher accuracy. 
2. Question regarding the frameworks you were presenting. Especially interesting is the difference between EU vs US: EU has all these different definitions, whereas US has only race. Would you have a recommendation on what would be a better term to use in the EU? How do we reason about this?
	- Example from Germany: After Soviet collapse, lots of immigrants coming to DE. They were heavily discriminated against, despite being white. How would you even define / describe such a group?
3. If you're using historical data, ethic data. How would you address differences in definition of ethnicity over longer periods of time?
	- example from UK: Irish were considered non-white in the past
4. The fact that nationality could be considered as ethnicity at all could be a form of discrimination (in regards to EU free movement laws?)
	- Do you also look at religion as a proxy?
	- Using nationality could be considered as a form of direct discrimination (depending on what you do with the outcome)
5. A few weeks ago the "national academy of sciences" in the US published an interesting report on using "population descriptors" instead of race.
6. Interesting how nationality is a proxy for ethnicity. The race equality directive does specifically exclude nationality in its guidance (*so I guess it's therefore not forbidden in that context?*)
7. What you really measure is the accuracy of the model. If the model is not accurate it's not fair (?). If you look at other groups e.g. look at students, lower income while they are students -> just because they are different form the average. Is there sth specific in ethnicity or is it just being a special group?
	- Is accuracy related to ethnicity groups? (*not sure*)

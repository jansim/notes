## Notes 

- Picking a proejct
	1. Select one of the project ideas by the industry partners
	2. Come up with your own project
- Should be different from PhD thesis
	- But best if it's closely related
- Fixed No. but chances are good? weird
	- Limitation for external Universities
- Matchmaking w/ Companies
- Main person: Stefan Jazdzejewski
- Multiple interview rounds
	- Only HR & Academic are about quality
	- Matching w/ company is less about quality more about match (more chill?)
- PhD Topic: CS or CS related
- Application: Brief, not that much space?

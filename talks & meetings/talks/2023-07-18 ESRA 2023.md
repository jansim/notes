## S1: Smart Surveys

### S1.1  
- [Surveys or digital trace data, which one should we use? Using Generalized MultiTrait-MultiMethod models to simultaneously estimate the measurement quality of surveys and digital trace data.](https://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/conf2023/prog.php?sess=14#573)
- MTMM for accessing quality of survey vs. digital trace data

## S2: [Data donation and linking digital trace data 1](https://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/conf2023/prog.php?sess=54#main)

### S2.1 Platform for data donation
- UVA
- People upload full data -> extract only the necessary parts -> researchers get access to that
- Infrastructure for data donation
	- [D3I](https://datadonation.eu)
	- [Port](https://github.com/eyra/port) built by https://eyra.co/ (Company doing RSE)

### S2.2
- compliance rates for data donation are low (possibility for non response bias)
- smartphone usage -> screen time
	- multiple screenshots of screen time
	- video of screen time
	- manual reporting
-

### S2.3
- Convenience sample, spotify data sampling
- spotify API auth, real time survey getting what they last listened to



# Day 2

## S1 [Combining Data Science and Survey Research to Improve (Training) Data Quality](https://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/conf2023/prog.php?sess=73#main)

### S1.1 [Improving Measurement Models using Deep Neural Networks. The case of Response Styles](https://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/conf2023/prog.php?sess=73#537)
- Predicting careless response patterns
- Based on among others mouse movement (pretty interesting way of tracking mouse movement)

### S1.2 [Automatic Scoring of Cognition Drawings - Assessing the quality of machine based scores against a gold-standard](https://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/conf2023/prog.php?sess=73#140)

### S1.3 [Improving Alignment between Survey Responses and Social Media Posts](https://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/conf2023/prog.php?sess=73#508)
- "Alignment" as the association between two data sources; not AI alignment
	- comovement as measure
- comparing survey w/ social media data
-

### S1.4: Jacob's talk
- Also look at different samples, gamification?
	- People participating for free?
- Questions
	- Is there a way to disentangle effects of the task structure from variation of annotators?
	- Fine-tuning, did you look at whether the fine-tuning on a small number of tweets has an effect? i.e. are your models stable, since there's always different seeds / randomness in the training? -> did this
	- These things are mainly done in English, how would these things transfer to other languages, esp. smaller languages
	- Have you tried to combine textual predictors + social demographic characterisitcs of tweet authors?

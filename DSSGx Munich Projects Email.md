Dear XX,

We are currently looking for project partners for DSSGx Munich 2024, a scholarship program where the very best from hundreds of applicants from across the world work on projects for the social good for 2 months. As a project partner you have the opportunity to have a team of 4 - 5 talented early-career data scientists help you with a data science project for 2 months free of charge, while we fairly pay the fellows for their time.

If you are interested, please reach out to projects@dssgxmunich.org to schedule a call.
